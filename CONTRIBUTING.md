# Contributing to Pallas

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## How to Contribute

### Contributing without writing code

Pallas is a fairly unique project and not necessarily suited to contribution by
the average engineer, but you can help us get in front of the right people:  
Please consider **starring** this repository or sharing it with others.
Particularly good matches will be those engineers who have experience with purely
functional programming, exokernels/unikernels, runtime development, Urbit, 
systems programming, and related areas.

### Reporting bugs

1. **Check for existing issues:** Before you create a new issue, please search in [our issues](https://github.com/operating-function/pallas/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
2. **Create a new issue:** If no existing issues fit your concern, [create a new issue](https://github.com/operating-function/pallas/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the problem.

### Submitting new examples

If you have ideas for a new demo/example, please submit it as a [new example issue](https://github.com/operating-function/pallas/issues/new?template=proposed_demo.md)

We will discuss it from there and invite you to submit a change (see below).

### Questions / Clarifications

There are many novel concepts introduced by Pallas, and though we strive to provide helpful documentation and comments there will inevitably be questions and needed clarifications. Where possible, we'd like to document these answers somewhere the next person can find them.

1. **Search the documentation**: Check the [documentation site](https://vaporware.gitbook.io/pallas) to see if your question is answered there.
2. **Search for existing questions:** Search our issues for questions similar to the one you have.
