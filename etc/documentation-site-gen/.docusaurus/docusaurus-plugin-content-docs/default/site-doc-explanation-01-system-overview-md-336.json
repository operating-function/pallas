  "description": "Pallas is a stack of technologies. At the bottom lies PLAN, an evaluation model. On top of PLAN we have two separate stacks: on one hand Rex and Sire allow programmers to implement programming languages which compile to PLAN, while a manifest format consisting of cogs and drivers is used to completely specify the behavior of a virtual machine that runs PLAN. Weâ€™ll start by explaining how these fit together on a high level, and then go into each one in detail.",
