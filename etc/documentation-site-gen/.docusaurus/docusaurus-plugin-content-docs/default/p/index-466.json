At the bottom lies PLAN, an evaluation model. On top of PLAN we have two separate stacks: on one hand Rex and Sire allow programmers to implement programming languages which compile to PLAN, while a manifest format consisting of cogs and drivers is used to completely specify the behavior of a virtual machine that runs PLAN. We’ll start by explaining how these fit together on a high level, and then go into each one in detail.","sidebar":"explanationSidebar"},"explanation/vm-and-interpreter":{"id":"explanation/vm-and-interpreter","title":"VM and Interpreter","description":"PLAN is a standard for representing compute and data in the abstract; a PLAN expression is a specification of a program.
