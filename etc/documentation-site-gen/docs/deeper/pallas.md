# Plunder vs Pallas

Pallas is a fork of the [Plunder project upstream](https://git.sr.ht/~plan/plunder)

::::warning
TODO:
- Why does the Pallas fork exist
  - Plunder is moving towards freezing ASAP. This is a mismatch with certain features that make it more usable _now_. Ultimately, The Operating Function will be built on a frozen base, but for now we may have to make some changes on our fork that would interrupt the proper thrust of Plunder core development.
