# Where To Go From Here

::::warning
Check back for additional web app tutorials. We plan to add example implementations for:

* A simple chat app
* Web3 login with an ethereum wallet
* A media gallery that supports uploading files directly into the SSI
* Much more
::::

There are a number of directions to go from here depending on your skills and interests. Some of these areas are covered in the deeper dives linked below.

* Learn more about how UI files are handled on the backend and see some examples of single-page web apps build on top of Pallas, then build some of your own.
* Study PLAN and implement the spec in your favorite language
* Extend Sire with macros
* Provide a [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) package
* If you're feeling extremely adventurous, write a Jet!
* Read through the Haskell runtime files in `lib/`
* Help improve these docs! [documentation repo](https://github.com/operating-function/pallas-docs)
* Improve the [Docker images](https://github.com/deathtothecorporation/pallas-docker)
* If you're interested in contributing to Pallas, the best place to do so is the [Pallas repository](https://github.com/operating-function/pallas)

Whatever you choose (or if you just have general questions), we look forward to helping you out in the [Pallas Telegram group](https://t.me/vaporwareNetwork).
