Like the EVM, program state is automatically persisted \u2013 programs can just keep everything in memory and will run forever (but there is no global consensus). Like Lisp, programs can universally introspect themselves and their environment, and dynamically introduce new code."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At the bottom lies a concurrency-oriented virtual machine whose behavior is completely specified by a user-supplied manifest. The manifest is specified using a standardized format which the virtual machine knows how to interpret and update during operation. This standardized format allows you to move your manifest to a different virtual machine on a different device, and pick up where you left off. The format is guaranteed to be backward compatible, so that programs continue to work even in the future. We aim to also maximize forward compatibility, so that an old machine can come online, receive code updates over the network, and continue to operate with as little degradation of service as possible."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The manifest is encoded in a format called PLAN. PLAN is a lambda-inspired combinator system which is purely functional, lazy, reflective, and has been optimized for data storage. It is very minimal and easy to implement efficiently. PLAN is used as a standard format for arbitrary compute and data, and manifests code for PLAN values of a particular shape, which codes for both compute and managed side effects."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"PLAN is human-readable but not human-writeable in practice.

Sire is very bare-bones, and is simply intended to be used to implement more capable languages."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Sire uses a syntax called Rex, for R-expressions. Rex is to Pallas as S-expressions are to Lisp: a single highly regular syntax that can be used by many different languages. Rex is almost as simple as pure S-expressions, and simpler than the actual syntaxes of all major Lisps, while being significantly more flexible: Rex can look very much like Python, Haskell or YAML. Using Rex, new languages can be defined as macros on top of Sire, simply rebinding its syntax to new semantics. This allows the system to be flexibly extended while reusing the lexer, parser and pretty-printer."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Taken together, these components give us a resilient, extensible and trust-minimized system that manages persistence, concurrency, portability and real-world interaction in a single unified model.
