    This is the per-cog event-log persistence logic that runs in
    `loggerAsync`.

    Event logging is almost entirely asynchronous w.r.t ship execution,
    the only exception is that some syscalls are "synchronous" and they
    need to block until the state that triggered them has been committed
    to disk.

    Like snapshotting, the decision of whether or not to write a log
    batch depends on the amount of cpu-work has been performed since
    the last batch.

    We also write a final log batch right before shutdown, if the daemon
    receives a SIGKILL.  This isn't synchronized with snapshot routine,
    so the final disk state will often be a snapshot with a single log
    batch that needs to be replayed, but this should be cheap in practice.

    There is also the `logImmediately` flag, which will cause the log
    to be written right away.  This is important for "synchronous" events,
    since we want to cause those to block for as little time as possible.

{-
    The is the per-machine snapshotting logic that runs in `snapshotAsync`.

    Snapshotting is fully asynchronous.  It doesn't block normal
    execution, so we allow it to lag behind the current state.

    When we replay, we load the latest snapshot, and then we find all
    of the log batches that come after that point.

    Here, we track the mount of CPU-work that will be required to replay those
    batches, and we wait until that reaches a certain threshold before
    taking a snapshot.
