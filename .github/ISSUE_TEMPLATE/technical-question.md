<!--
There are many novel concepts introduced by Pallas, and though we strive to provide helpful documentation and comments there will inevitably be questions and needed clarifications. Where possible, we'd like to document these answers somewhere the next person can find them - whether that's in the documentation or by clarifying source code where relevant.

1. **Search the documentation**: Check the [documentation site](https://vaporware.gitbook.io/pallas) to see if your question is answered there.
2. **Search for existing questions:** Search our issues for questions similar to the one you have.
3. If you haven't found anything you can either ask us about it [on Telegram](https://t.me/vaporwareNetwork), or proceed with this issue!


Please delete comments like this one before submitting the issue,
thanks! :)

### Context

<!--
What is the context of this question or clarification request?
Some examples include:
- Sire syntax clarification
- "I do X task in Y other programming language, how do I do it in Sire?"
- Clarification about which component of the system is responsible for a given task
- The Haskell runtime
- Other runtime implementations
- How Pallas interacts with the host OS
- Questions about existing examples or demos
- Something else - a brief description is fine.
